I used 3 tutorial videos on YouTube to write the code in a short and convenient way:

ABOUT THE GAME TIC TAC TOE:
THERE ARE SOME RULES OF THIS GAME...
To start the game click on a new game, if not u will not able to click on the cells.
The first one to click on the cell is X and the next in line will be O and then X again and so on...
The game has a timer, of 30 seconds. As soon as u clicked on the new game button, the game starts and the timer is activated, for each turn the clock resets back to 30 seconds, in case someone who currently has his turn in the game and did not click on any of the cells he will automatically lose due to his time running out and you will be notified on screen.
The first player to get 3 of his marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
If all cells are full(no empty) and there is no strike happend(3marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally)),The game will end in a draw.
After the game end you can start new game and play again, or just click on the end game button to finish the game.

WISH YOU ALL THE BEST AND HAPPY MERRY CHRISTMAS :)
